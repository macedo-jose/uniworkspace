- visibility: access to 'components' attribute is possible --> use access modifiers
- show() is only available in subclasses of Layout; renders Layout's purpose as base class virtually useless --> make (abstract) method of Layout
- Components are shown (i.e. printed) via toString --> should make show (polymorphic) behavior of Component
- cannot change Layout independently of Components afterwards --> should create separate Container to hold Components
- error handling is crappy --> Exception handling (later)
